          <Text style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}>
            The Website’s services (the <InlineBold>“Services”</InlineBold>) include without
            limitation providing methods and information to enable those who access the Website (
            <InlineBold>“Participants”</InlineBold>) to access to or participate in the Synthetix
            decentralized, autonomous financial market mechanism powered by blockchain-enforced
            smart contracts (the <InlineBold>“Protocol”</InlineBold>
            ). The Protocol is intended to be provided and operate in a decentralized manner,
            meaning that individual SNX contributors and the SNX DAO, have no ability to control,
            modify, prevent, stop, amend, or adjust interactions or transactions after they are
            submitted to the Protocol, whether or not through the Interface. Further, the Interface
            is not the only method that individuals or parties may interact with, contribute to,
            access, or otherwise affect the Protocol. Thus, the Services (including the Website and
            the Interface) are distinct from the Protocol, and any of the Protocol’s products or
            offerings should not be viewed as products or offerings provided by SNX or the Website.
            <InlineBold>
              You are expected to be familiar with the Protocol and the risks it represents
              (including without limitation the possibility of your crypto-assets being forfeited
              according to the Protocol’s rules or being lost for any other reason) before accessing
              it (whether accessed via the Interface or otherwise). YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT
              YOUR USE OR INTERACTION WITH THE PROTOCOL IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND SNX WAIVES ALL
              LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY, AND MAKES NO WARRANTIES, RELATED TO THE PROTOCOL, WHETHER
              OR NOT THE PROTOCOL IS ACCESSED VIA OUR SERVICES.

            <Text style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}>
              Your full use and enjoyment of the Services (whether or not by using the Interface)
              may require you to pay transactional fees required by their underlying blockchain or
              distributed ledger service, or by the Protocol itself, that are designed to encourage
              their intended use among the Protocol’s participants (
              <InlineBold>“Blockchain Fees”</InlineBold>
              ). These Blockchain Fees are not levied directly by SNX, but rather are determined by
              your use of the Services and the rules placed by corresponding Protocol and underlying
              blockchain communities at large. You acknowledge that SNX has no control over
              Blockchain Fees, (including, without limitation, their applicability, payment,
              amounts, transmission, transmission, intended operation, and effectiveness) whether
              related to your use of the Services or otherwise, and agree that in no event will SNX
              be responsible to you or any other part for the payment, repayment, refund,
              disbursement, indemnity, or for any other aspect of your use or transmission of
              Blockchain Fees. For further information regarding blockchain technology,

              To access certain Services or some of the resources offered on the Website, the User
              may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information. Other
              Services or resources offered on the Website (such as the Interface) may require the
              User to utilize certain Web3 capabilities, such a crypto-asset wallet capable of

              <InlineBold>“Web3 Utilities”</InlineBold>

              the direct, explicit permission of the party who created the relevant private key(s).

              If the User utilizes a Web3 Utility that relies on a separate username, password,

              User must treat such information as confidential, and the User must not disclose that
              information to any other person or entity. The User also acknowledges that any
              identity linked to its Web3 Utility is personal to the User and agrees not to provide
              any other person with access to such identity. The User also agrees to ensure that it
              will lock or otherwise prevent its Web3 Utility from unauthorized use on this Website
              or the Services at the end of each session. The User should use particular caution
              when accessing the Website or the Services from a public or shared computer so that
              others are not able to view or record the User’s username, password, private key, or
              other personal information. In the event the User’s Web3 credentials are compromised,
              they User acknowledges and understands that all of its related crypto-assets may be
              compromised as well, and waives any and all responsibility of and liability against

          <Text style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}>
            Blockchains, DEXs, DeFi, crypto-assets, the Protocol, and their related technologies and
            functionalities are still emerging innovations that carry a relatively high amount of
            foreseeable and unforeseeable risk from security, financial, technical, political,
            social, and personal safety standpoints. The mere access to and interaction with
            blockchains requires high degrees of skill and knowledge to operate with a relative
            degree of safety and proficiency. Crypto-assets are highly volatile in nature due to
            many diverse factors, including without limitation use and adoption, speculation,
            manipulation, technology, security, and legal and regulatory developments and
            application. Further, the speed and cost of transacting with cryptographic technologies,
            such as blockchains like those underlying the Protocol, are variable and highly
            volatile. Moreover, the transparent nature of many blockchains means that any
            interactions the User has with the Protocol and any blockchain may be publicly visible
            and readable in human form.

              By accessing and using the Website or the Services, the User acknowledges the

              (including without limitation any specific technical language used in this Agreement).
              The User further represents that it has all knowledge sufficient to work, and is
              informed of all foreseeable risks and the possibility of unforeseeable risks,
              associated with blockchains, crypto-assets, Web3 Utilities, smart contracts, the
              Interface, the Protocol, and the Services. The User further acknowledges, and assumes

              Interface, or Services may be inaccurate, possibly due to another party’s malicious
