            Blockchains, DEXs, DeFi, crypto-assets, the Protocol, and their related technologies and
            functionalities are still emerging innovations that carry a relatively high amount of
            foreseeable and unforeseeable risk from security, financial, technical, political,
            social, and personal safety standpoints. The mere access to and interaction with
            blockchains requires high degrees of skill and knowledge to operate with a relative
            degree of safety and proficiency. Crypto-assets are highly volatile in nature due to
            many diverse factors, including without limitation use and adoption, speculation,
            manipulation, technology, security, and legal and regulatory developments and
            application. Further, the speed and cost of transacting with cryptographic technologies,
            such as blockchains like those underlying the Protocol, are variable and highly
            volatile. Moreover, the transparent nature of many blockchains means that any
            interactions the User has with the Protocol and any blockchain may be publicly visible
            and readable in human form.
