# Managing Debt

## Collateralization Ratio

_Coming soon._

## Mint and Burn sUSD

_Coming soon._

<!--
Stakers can mint and burn sUSD, a decentralized stablecoin backed by the collateral in the Synthetix system. This directly effects the debt responsibility of the account: each dollar of sUSD minted adds $1 of debt responsibility to the account and each dollar of sUSD burned reduces the debt responsbility by $1.

## Minting sUSD

Stakers can take out loans of sUSD against the collateral they've staked. Taking out an sUSD loan is also referred to as minting sUSD. These loans do not accrue interest. sUSD can be exchanged in synth markets and used in futures markets.

## Burning sUSD

Stakers can repay loans, also called burning sUSD. sUSD can be purchased on the open market and burned to reduce an accountâ€™s debt (to increase its C-Ratio) regardless of whether this debt was accrued from minting sUSD or from debt inflation delegated from a fund.
